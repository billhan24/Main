                    Chinese culture has been around for almost 3000 years. It shapes the way Chinese people express their emotions and communication with each other. The purpose of this website is to educate and teach you about China's culture and how it impacts their culture, communication, mannerisms, and traditional values. Chinese culture has so many unique and interesting aspects to it, I encourage you to learn more.
