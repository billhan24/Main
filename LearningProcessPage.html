                   On the right, there is a quiz that will go through the main elements of Chinese culture. If you want to become more involved with Chinese culture, it is important that you understand how it works, as well as the main facts regarding Chinese culture. The content above will prepare you for the questions that will be asked in the quiz. The questions will be about the lifestyle, manners, and mindset of Chinese people. It is essential that you understand what it is like being in Chinese society in order to become more involved with the culture. It's important that you understand mannerisms so you know what Chinese people mean when they speak and when they use their body language that is unique to only them. The questions will be multiple choice questions that are related to the main aspects of Chinese culture and how China as a country is. This will help you be able to communicate with Chinese friends, family, and citizens even better. I urge you to learn more about Chinese culture as it is very interesting and there will always be more to learn since it is the longest written history ever.
