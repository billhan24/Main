                    Chinese history has one of the longest written histories ever. Over 2,000 years of history has been documented which shapes the structure of Chinese culture and Chinese society. China has an interesting history with many dynasties, conflicts, and influences. Watch the video to the right to get a brief understanding of Chinese history over the last 2,000 years.

                    Recent Chinese history has suffered from a lot of colonisation from the likes of Japan in the 20th century. This has in turn shaped the way Chinese society functions as Japan made many changes to Chinese culture and society, effectively changing how we communicate and act with each other. Lots of history has also tried to be erased by the Japanese during the colonisation period.

                    Chinese history shapes the way that people communicate with each other because, historically, body language expresses feelings, emotions, and desires from Chinese people. It also changes the way people express themselves within the household because culture, identity, and religion dictates a lot of what is done in Chinese households.

                    Within China’s boundaries exists a highly diverse and complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and one of the lowest places on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable mountainous terrain to vast coastal lowlands. Its climate ranges from extremely dry, desertlike conditions in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast, and China has the greatest contrast in temperature between its northern and southern borders of any country in the world. The diversity of both China’s relief and its climate has resulted in one of the world’s widest arrays of ecological niches, and these niches have been filled by a vast number of plant and animal species. Indeed, practically all types of Northern Hemisphere plants, except those of the polar tundra, are found in China, and, despite the continuous inroads of humans over the millennia, China still is home to some of the world’s most exotic animals. Probably the single most identifiable characteristic of China to the people of the rest of the world is the size of its population. Some one-fifth of humanity is of Chinese nationality. The great majority of the population is Chinese (Han), and thus China is often characterized as an ethnically homogeneous country, but few countries have as wide a variety of indigenous peoples as does China. Even among the Han there are cultural and linguistic differences between regions; for example, the only point of linguistic commonality between two individuals from different parts of China may be the written Chinese language. Because China’s population is so enormous, the population density of the country is also often thought to be uniformly high, but vast areas of China are either uninhabited or sparsely populated.
